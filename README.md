# display_screenshot

A custom ESPHome component that adds remote screenshots to any ESP32 display over HTTP.

Add it to your device's YAML config alongside your existing display setup, compile and flash as normal, and your device's built-in web server gains a new `/screenshot` endpoint. It serves a pixel-perfect BMP of the live framebuffer, switches pages remotely with `?page=N`, and exposes a JSON info endpoint for discovering available pages.

Open the URL in any browser to see the screenshot directly:
```
http://<YOUR-DEVICE-IP>/screenshot
```

Or save it from the command line:
```bash
# Linux / macOS / Windows (Command Prompt)
curl -o screenshot.bmp http://<YOUR-DEVICE-IP>/screenshot

# Windows (PowerShell)
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://<YOUR-DEVICE-IP>/screenshot -OutFile screenshot.bmp
```

---

## Why?

If you're building display UIs on ESPHome, the dev cycle is painful: edit YAML, compile, upload, walk over, squint at a small TFT, walk back, repeat. This component lets you see what's on screen from anywhere -- just open a URL in your browser.

With these screenshots you can:

- **Let your coding agent close the loop.** After every display lambda change, Claude Code / Codex / Gemini / your coding agent of choice can `curl` a screenshot, view the BMP, and verify the layout looks right -- without you ever looking at the device. This is the use case that prompted the component: AI-assisted display development where the agent can check its own work.
- **Monitor ESPHome devices remotely.** Expose the endpoint through ngrok or a Cloudflare tunnel and see what your device is displaying from anywhere. Useful for devices mounted on walls, inside enclosures, or at a different site entirely. No VPN needed.
- **Integrate with Home Assistant.** Fire a webhook that fetches the screenshot and posts it to a notification, Lovelace card, or Telegram bot. "What does the controller screen say right now?" -- answered without leaving the couch.
- **Auto-generate documentation.** Script a loop that hits `/screenshot/info` to discover all pages, captures each one, and dumps them into a docs folder. Re-run after every UI change and your docs stay current.
- **Run visual regression tests.** Capture baseline screenshots, make changes, capture again, diff. Catch layout breakage before it ships.
- **Debug remotely.** "The display looks wrong" -- now you can see exactly what they see without asking them to photograph their screen.

## Example Screenshots

These were captured from [ay129-35MR/tadoHotWaterKnob](https://github.com/ay129-35MR/tadoHotWaterKnob) hot water controller built with an ESP32-S3 and a ST7789V 240x320 TFT (rotated to landscape), driven by a rotary encoder:

  <img width="1080" height="922" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b285218-b3c6-4d6f-9b8c-42ce44d5ac81" />
 
The device has 6 pages managed via a `globals<int>`. Each image was fetched with a single HTTP request to `/screenshot?page=N` and converted from BMP to PNG.

| Page 3 -- Cleaning Schedule | Page 4 -- Camera | Page 5 -- Display Brightness |

To capture a specific page, add `?page=N` to the URL -- in your browser or from the command line:
```bash
# Capture all pages in a loop
for p in 0 1 2 3 4 5; do
  curl -s -o "page${p}.bmp" "http://<YOUR-DEVICE-IP>/screenshot?page=${p}"
done
```

---

## What it supports

Three page modes, covering every common ESPHome display pattern:

| Mode | Config | How it works |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **Single screen** | Just `display_id` | Captures whatever's on screen. No page switching. |
| **Native pages** | `pages: [page_main, ...]` | Uses ESPHome's built-in `pages:` system. Switches with `?page=N`. |
| **Global-based pages** | `page_global: current_page` | For UIs that track the current page with a `globals` int. |

Two HTTP endpoints:

| Endpoint | Returns |
|----------|---------|
| `GET /screenshot[?page=N]` | 24-bit BMP image of the display |
| `GET /screenshot/info` | JSON with page count, dimensions, mode, and page names |

Open any of these in your browser, or use curl to save to a file:

```
http://<YOUR-DEVICE-IP>/screenshot            # current screen
http://<YOUR-DEVICE-IP>/screenshot?page=2     # specific page
http://<YOUR-DEVICE-IP>/screenshot/info        # JSON metadata
```

```bash
curl -o screenshot.bmp http://<YOUR-DEVICE-IP>/screenshot
curl -o page2.bmp "http://<YOUR-DEVICE-IP>/screenshot?page=2"
curl http://<YOUR-DEVICE-IP>/screenshot/info
# {"pages":3,"width":320,"height":240,"mode":"native_pages","page_names":["Main","Graph","Settings"]}
```

---

## Requirements

- **ESP32** -- PSRAM is recommended, but optional. The component needs enough free RAM for a full BMP buffer (~225 KB at 320x240). By default it prefers PSRAM and falls back to internal RAM.
- **Display using RGB565** -- any `DisplayBuffer` subclass in `BITS_16` colour mode (ILI9XXX, ST7789V, ILI9341, ILI9488, etc.), or `rpi_dpi_rgb` displays when `backend: rpi_dpi_rgb` is set
- **`web_server` component enabled** -- the screenshot endpoint hooks into ESPHome's built-in web server

---

## Quick Start

> **You only need to edit your ESPHome YAML file.** The `.h` and `.cpp` files are the component source -- don't modify them. All configuration is done in YAML.
>
> The examples below use placeholder values you'll need to replace:
> - **`<YOUR-DEVICE-IP>`** -- your ESP32's IP address (find it in ESPHome logs or your router's DHCP table)
> - **`my_display`** -- the `id` of your display component in your YAML
> - **`your-device.yaml`** -- your ESPHome YAML filename

### 1. Get the component

**Option A -- Reference it directly from GitHub in your YAML (easiest):**

No download needed -- ESPHome fetches the component automatically at compile time:

```yaml
external_components:
  - source:
      type: git
      url: https://github.com/ay129-35MR/esphome-display-screenshot
    components: [display_capture]
```

**Option B -- Download and copy the files manually:**

Download the repo from GitHub and copy the `display_capture` folder into your ESPHome `components/` directory:

```
your-esphome-config/
  components/
    display_capture/
      __init__.py              <-- component source (don't edit)
      display_capture.h        <-- component source (don't edit)
      display_capture.cpp      <-- component source (don't edit)
  your-device.yaml             <-- YOUR config (edit this)
```

**Option C -- Clone with git:**

```bash
cd /path/to/your/esphome/config
git clone https://github.com/ay129-35MR/esphome-display-screenshot.git components/display_capture
```

### 2. Make sure you have `web_server` enabled

If you don't already have this in your YAML, add it:

```yaml
web_server:
  port: 80
```

### 3. Tell ESPHome where to find the component

If you used Option B or C (local files), add this to your YAML:

```yaml
external_components:
  - source:
      type: local
      path: components
```

If you used Option A (git), you already did this in step 1.

### 4. Add the `display_capture` block

Pick the config that matches your setup (see [Which page mode do I need?](#which-page-mode-do-i-need) below):

```yaml
# Simplest -- just capture whatever's on screen
display_capture:
  display_id: my_display  # <-- change to match YOUR display's id
  # backend: rpi_dpi_rgb  # uncomment for rpi_dpi_rgb displays (ESP32-S3 RGB LCD panels)
  # memory: auto          # auto (default), psram, or internal
```

### 5. Compile, upload, and test

Compile and flash your device the way you normally would:

- **Home Assistant ESPHome add-on:** Open the ESPHome dashboard in HA, click the three-dot menu on your device, and hit **Install**.
- **ESPHome web dashboard:** Click **Install** â†’ **Wirelessly** (or **Plug into this computer** for first flash).
- **CLI:** `esphome run your-device.yaml`

Once it's running, open `http://<YOUR-DEVICE-IP>/screenshot` in any browser -- you'll see (or download) a BMP of your display. Or from the command line:

```bash
# Linux / macOS
curl -o screenshot.bmp http://<YOUR-DEVICE-IP>/screenshot

# Windows (PowerShell)
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://<YOUR-DEVICE-IP>/screenshot -OutFile screenshot.bmp
```

That's it. You should see a pixel-perfect BMP of your display.

---

## Which page mode do I need?

Look at how your display is set up in YAML and pick the matching config:

### "I have a single screen with a `lambda:` -- no pages"

```yaml
# Your display config probably looks like:
display:
  - platform: ili9xxx
    id: my_display
    lambda: |-
      it.printf(10, 10, id(font), "Hello World");

# Just add this:
display_capture:
  display_id: my_display
```

`?page=N` is ignored in this mode -- there's only one screen to capture.

### "I use ESPHome's built-in `pages:` system"

```yaml
# Your display config probably looks like:
display:
  - platform: ili9xxx
    id: my_display
    pages:
      - id: page_main
        lambda: |-
          it.printf(10, 10, id(font), "Main");
      - id: page_graph
        lambda: |-
          // graph code...
      - id: page_settings
        lambda: |-
          it.printf(10, 10, id(font), "Settings");

# List the same page IDs here:
display_capture:
  display_id: my_display
  pages:
    - page_main
    - page_graph
    - page_settings
  page_names: ["Main", "Graph", "Settings"]  # optional, shows up in /info
```

Now `?page=0` captures page_main, `?page=1` captures page_graph, etc.

### "I track the current page with a `globals` int"

This is common in complex UIs where a rotary encoder or button sets an integer and the display lambda switches on it.

```yaml
# Your globals probably look like:
globals:
  - id: current_page
    type: int
    restore_value: no
    initial_value: '0'

# And your display lambda does something like:
# if (id(current_page) == 0) { ... } else if (id(current_page) == 1) { ... }

# Point display_capture at the global:
display_capture:
  display_id: my_display
  page_global: current_page
  sleep_global: is_sleeping     # optional -- if you have a sleep/screensaver global
  page_names: ["Main", "History", "Settings"]  # optional
```

**Note:** `pages` and `page_global` are mutually exclusive -- ESPHome will reject your config if you specify both.

---

## Endpoints

Once running, your device exposes two new HTTP endpoints:

### `GET /screenshot`

Returns a 24-bit BMP image of the current display. Open in a browser or save from the command line:

```
http://<YOUR-DEVICE-IP>/screenshot
```

```bash
curl -o screenshot.bmp http://<YOUR-DEVICE-IP>/screenshot
```

### `GET /screenshot?page=N`

Switches to page N (0-indexed), captures it, then switches back. The physical display flashes briefly (~50ms).

```
http://<YOUR-DEVICE-IP>/screenshot?page=2
```

```bash
curl -o page2.bmp "http://<YOUR-DEVICE-IP>/screenshot?page=2"
```

To save all pages at once:
```bash
for p in 0 1 2 3; do
  curl -s -o "page${p}.bmp" "http://<YOUR-DEVICE-IP>/screenshot?page=${p}"
done
```

### `GET /screenshot/info`

Returns JSON metadata -- useful for scripts that need to discover pages automatically. Open in your browser to see the JSON directly, or fetch with curl:

```
http://<YOUR-DEVICE-IP>/screenshot/info
```

```bash
curl http://<YOUR-DEVICE-IP>/screenshot/info
```

```json
{
  "pages": 3,
  "width": 320,
  "height": 240,
  "mode": "native_pages",
  "page_names": ["Main", "Graph", "Settings"]
}
```

### Response Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 200 | Success -- BMP or JSON returned |
| 500 | BMP allocation failed (device out of memory for selected memory mode) |
| 504 | Main loop didn't respond in 5 seconds (device too busy) |

---

## Configuration Reference

| Key | Type | Required | Description |
|-----|------|----------|-------------|
| `display_id` | ID | **Yes** | Your display component's `id` |
| `pages` | list of IDs | No | `DisplayPage` IDs -- for ESPHome native pages |
| `page_global` | ID | No | `globals` int that tracks the current page |
| `sleep_global` | ID | No | `globals` bool -- wakes display before capture |
| `page_names` | list of strings | No | Human-readable names for the `/screenshot/info` endpoint |
| `backend` | string | No | Framebuffer backend: `display_buffer` (default) or `rpi_dpi_rgb` for ESP32-S3 RGB LCD panels |
| `memory` | string | No | BMP buffer allocation strategy: `auto` (default, PSRAM then internal), `psram`, or `internal` |

---

## Troubleshooting

### Linker error: undefined reference to vtable

PlatformIO's CMake cache doesn't know about the new `.cpp` file. Do a **Clean Build** (one-time fix):

- **Home Assistant ESPHome add-on / web dashboard:** Click the three-dot menu on your device â†’ **Clean Build Files**, then install again.
- **CLI:** Delete the cached build files and recompile:
  ```bash
  rm -rf .esphome/build/<YOUR-DEVICE>/.pioenvs/<YOUR-DEVICE>/CMakeCache.txt \
         .esphome/build/<YOUR-DEVICE>/.pioenvs/<YOUR-DEVICE>/CMakeFiles/
  ```

This only happens once -- subsequent compiles will pick up the file automatically.

### 504 timeout on `/screenshot`

The main ESPHome loop didn't respond within 5 seconds. This usually means:
- The device is very busy (heavy sensor polling, large display updates)
- The `display_id` doesn't match your actual display component's ID

### 500 error on `/screenshot`

BMP allocation failed for the selected memory mode. Try one of these:

- Set `memory: auto` (default) so it can fall back to internal RAM when PSRAM isn't available.
- Set `memory: internal` explicitly on boards without PSRAM.
- Reduce display resolution to lower BMP size.
- Free RAM elsewhere (disable unneeded components/logging).

If you're expecting PSRAM, verify that your board actually has it and it's enabled. For ESP32-S3, you may need:

```yaml
esp32:
  board: esp32-s3-devkitc-1
  framework:
    type: arduino
psram:
  mode: octal  # or quad, depending on your board
```

### Screenshot is all black

If you're using `sleep_global`, make sure the global ID matches the bool your display lambda checks. The component sets it to `false` before capture, captures, then restores it.

If you're not using sleep, check that your display lambda is actually drawing something (add a test `it.fill(Color(255, 0, 0));` to confirm).

### Screenshot colours look wrong

The component assumes RGB565 (BITS_16) buffer format, which is the default for ILI9XXX displays. If your display uses a different colour mode, the output will be garbled.

---

## How It Works (for the curious)

### Thread Safety

ESPHome's web server runs on a separate FreeRTOS task from the main loop. The display buffer can only be safely accessed from the main loop. The component uses a binary semaphore to coordinate:

```
HTTP task                                Main loop
----------                               ---------
handleRequest()
  set request_pending_ = true
  xSemaphoreTake(5s timeout)
  ... blocks ...                         loop() sees request_pending_
                                           wake display if sleeping
                                           switch to requested page
                                           display_->update()
                                           read buffer -> BMP in configured RAM
                                           restore original page + sleep
                                           xSemaphoreGive() ---+
  semaphore acquired  <------------------------------------|
  send BMP response
  free BMP buffer
```

### Protected Buffer Access

`DisplayBuffer::buffer_` is `protected` in ESPHome -- there's no public API to read pixels back. The component uses `#define protected public` in a separate `.cpp` translation unit. This is the standard approach for accessing ESPHome internals without forking the framework.

### Rotation Handling

The output BMP always matches what you see on the physical display, regardless of rotation setting. The component applies the inverse of ESPHome's rotation transform when reading pixels back from the buffer.
